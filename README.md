***Computer Vision - Object Detection using Binary Image Processing***

---

Running Project3.py will load in neuron.jpg and blood-cells_12.Red-blood-ce.jpg
and perform the following Morphological Transformations, using the cv2 library, on the images to find the number of objects each photo:
  - Convert to binary.
  - Perform closing using a window of 9x9 pixels, and 3x3 pixels respectively.
  - Open image2 (blood-cells_12.Red-blood-ce.jp) with window of 3x3 pixels.
  - Draw contours on image2.
  - Open image2 again with window of 5x5 pixels.
  - Draw contours on image2 again.

The script will display the images after each operation. Make sure to close the windows to allow script to finish executing.
